I choose to make Tiffany Choi's Design

** I added a mobile design ** 

For the structure of the webpage, I started my dividing the design into 3 sections: the Title, the left div, and the right div. The left focused on today's information, and the right had the week's information. 

The week's information is divided into 5 divs each containing information for each of the future days. 

In each of the days, I had 3 inline blocks to store the day, image, and temperture. 

I mostly followed the design Tiffany provided, and only made minor changes. For example the font size differs slightly from her design.

For the software design I followed the MCV model. I made a file for each of the model, view, and controlled. In the model, I only had two properties for each of the data that you get back for the woeid api and the Yahoo api. 

The control was the different "call back functions" and button function. 

In the View, I appended divs. I could have made the divs in the html, but I thought we had to follow the design of the Quiz. If I had to do it again I would make the structure in the html. I passed in the data from the model through parameters in the view functions.  

I include a library to get rid of the broswers custom designs; this is the suggestion from Friday. I did this to help make the css better.
