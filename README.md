# myWeatherApp

This is my Weather App. The design was made by a design student at UC Davis, Tiffany Choi. 
This was my first using a API and working with JSON. The weather app was made from scratch using htmt, css, and javascript. 

#Usage
The default location for the weather app is Davis, California. 

You can change the location by typing in the Zip code (or name) in the text back and then CLICKING the Go button.
